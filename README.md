# Professional README Generator

## Description

This project is an application which allows users to generate a README.md file based on their responses to prompts in the node terminal.  The user's answers will be automatically written to a README file with the Markdown formatting applied.  The goal of this project was to make it easier for developers to create professional README files for their projects.
Through building this project, I practiced using node.js, as well as node's fs module to write to files, and the feature which allows the exporting and importing of my own modules.  I also developed my skills with using the Inquirer package to prompt the user for input in the terminal.

## Installation

To install the project, you will need to use node to install Inquirer, using the "npm install" command. To run the project, open the README-generator in the terminal and use the command "node index.js" to get started.

## Usage

To use the project, run the code by entering "node index.js" in the terminal.  You will be prompted to answer a series of questions about your project.  Once you have completed answering the questions, a file entitled "README2.md" will be created, with all of the information you entered inside the appropriate README sections.  It will also generate a license badge near the top of the page based on which license (if any) you chose to use for your project.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
